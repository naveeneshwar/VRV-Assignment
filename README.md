Log Analysis Report

Overview:
This project involves writing a Python script to process web server log files, analyze the data, and extract key information such as request counts, most accessed endpoints, and suspicious activities (like brute-force login attempts). The script performs the following tasks:
1) Count Requests per IP Address
2) Identify the Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint
3) Detect Suspicious Activity
The results are displayed in a clear and organized format in the terminal and for easy review all results (requests per IP, most accessed endpoint, suspicious activity) are saved in a CSV file.

Submission Files:
•	Python scripts (log_analysis.py).
•	log_analysis_results.csv file containing the output data.
